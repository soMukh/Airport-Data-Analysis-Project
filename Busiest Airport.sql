### Assess flight frequency and identify high-traffic corridors.
# To assess flight frequency and identify high-traffic corridors, we will:
# 1.Count how often each route (origin → destination) appears — that’s flight frequency.
# 2.Identify routes with the highest number of flights — these are high-traffic corridors.
